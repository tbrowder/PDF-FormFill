To initialize the data overlay process,
populate classes for the total data input,
one set for each page.

Each data line has its own class.
See separate module Classes;

Create a sub to read the user's data and use the fields to create a hash used by the module. Creation is dynamic at run time.

See new module Subs.

The example overlay case should have its own data file or sub created on the fly or??

The template files (new if necessary) should have the names of the desired format for each overlay entry.

How does it all fit together with no duplicate data.
