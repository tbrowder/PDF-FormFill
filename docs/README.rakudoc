=head1 NAME

B<PDF::Overlay> - Given a text file with instructions, overlays data on pages of an input PDF document

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=begin code :lang<raku>
use PDF::Overlay;
...
=end code

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<PDF::Overlay> provides the user with the capability to overlay desired graphics
on the pages of an existing PDF document. In order to do that, the user must
first create a text file with appropriate instructions. Then use that file
with the Raku script installed with this package.

=head2 The Raku script, C<pdf-overlay>

=begin code
pdf-overlay --pdf-in <input PDF to overlay> --overlay <overlay description file> 
    --pdf-out <output PDF>
=end code

=head2 The overlay description file

=head3 Line format

The user's desires are shown in single, coded input line. Blank lines and
comments from a '#' to the end of a line are ignored. Each data line is
first broken into one or more groups by a C<:> (colon) and a C<;> (semicolon).
For example, this C<key0:> is one string group, this C<key1: some data> 
becomes two string groups, and this 
C<key2: other data; more data> has three string groups.
The first group contains a code that governs some action. Any remaining
groups provide information to contruct a specific overlay item or some
attribute of the overlay. 

Notes:

=item comments and blank lines are allowed but ignored.
=item any line without a beginning C<code:> is ignored.
=item paper size must be Letter (default) or A4.
